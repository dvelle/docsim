This package provides lots of utility funtions to process html documents. 
Sample funtions include:
    remove tags
    extract information in some tags (extract heading tags, emphasis tags...)
    stop word removal
    stemming (Paice Stemmer and Porter Stemmer)
    ...

These utility function can be used to construct a pipe:
    
    input text -> html process 1 -> html process 2 -> html process3 -> output text

Users can easily add more processing function, remove a processing function...

TODO:
    After I changed the main code, the test code has not been changed
    accordingly. So I rename src/test to src/test2. In the future,
    the test code should be modified.
