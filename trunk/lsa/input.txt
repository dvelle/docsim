	1 general information about mysql this is the mysql reference manual it documents mysql version 3237alpha mysql is a very fast multithreaded multiuser and robust sql structured query language database server for unix and os2 platforms mysql is basically free for microsoft platforms you must get a mysql license after a trial time of 30 days see section 3 mysql licensing and support the mysql home page provides the latest information about mysql for a discussion of mysql capabilities see section 14 the main features of mysql for installation instructions see section 4 installing mysql for tips on porting mysql to new machines or operating systems see section g comments on porting to other systems for information about upgrading from a 321 release see section 4162 upgrading from a 321 version to 322 for a tutorial introduction to mysql see section 8 mysql tutorial for examples of sql and benchmarking information see the benchmarking directory sqlbench in the distribution for a history of new features and bug fixes see section d mysql change history for a list of currently known bugs and misfeatures see section e known errors and design deficiencies in mysql for future plans see section f list of things we want to add to mysql in the future the todo for a list of all the contributors to this project see section c contributors to mysql important send bug error reports questions and comments to the mailing list at for source distributions the mysqlbug script can be found in the scripts directory for binary distributions mysqlbug can be found in the bin directory if you have any suggestions concerning additions or corrections to this manual please send them to the manual team at docsmysqlcom 11 what is mysql mysql is a true multiuser multithreaded sql database server sql structured query language is the most popular and standardized database language in the world mysql is a clientserver implementation that consists of a server daemon mysqld and many different client programs and libraries sql is a standardized language that makes it easy to store update and access information for example you can use sql to retrieve product information and store customer information for a web site mysql is also fast and flexible enough to allow you to store logs and pictures in it the main goals of mysql are speed robustness and ease of use mysql was originally developed because we needed a sql server that could handle very large databases an order of magnitude faster than what any database vendor could offer to us on inexpensive hardware we have now been using mysql since 1996 in an environment with more than 40 databases containing 10000 tables of which more than 500 have more than 7 million rows this is about 100 gigabytes of missioncritical data the base upon which mysql is built is a set of routines that have been used in a highly demanding production environment for many years although mysql is still under development it already offers a rich and highly useful function set the official way to pronounce mysql is my ess que ell not mysequel 12 about this manual this manual is currently available in texinfo plain text info html postscript and pdf versions because of their size postscript and pdf versions are not included with the main mysql distribution but are available for separate download at httpwwwmysqlcom the primary document is the texinfo file the html version is produced automatically with a modified version of texi2html the plain text and info versions are produced with makeinfo the postscript version is produced using texi2dvi and dvips the pdf version is produced with pdftex this manual is written and maintained by david axmark michael monty widenius paul dubois and kim aldale for other contributors see section c contributors to mysql 121 conventions used in this manual this manual uses certain typographical conventions constant constantwidth font is used for command names and options sql statements database table and column names c and perl code and environment variables example to see how mysqladmin works invoke it with the help option filename constantwidth font with surrounding quotes is used for filenames and pathnames example the distribution is installed under the usrlocal directory c constantwidth font with surrounding quotes is also used to indicate character sequences example to specify a wildcard use the  character italic italic font is used for emphasis like this boldface boldface font is used for access privilege names eg do not grant the process privilege lightly and to convey especially strong emphasis when commands are shown that are meant to be executed by a particular program the program is indicated by the prompt shown with the command for example shell indicates a command that you execute from your login shell and mysql indicates a command that you execute from the mysql client shell type a shell command here mysql type a mysql command here shell commands are shown using bourne shell syntax if you are using a cshstyle shell you may need to issue commands slightly differently for example the sequence to set an environment variable and run a command looks like this in bourne shell syntax shell varnamevalue somecommand for csh you would execute the sequence like this shell setenv varname value shell somecommand database table and column names often must be substituted into commands to indicate that such substitution is necessary this manual uses dbname tblname and colname for example you might see a statement like this mysql select colname from dbnametblname this means that if you were to enter a similar statement you would supply your own database table and column names perhaps like this mysql select authorname from bibliodbauthorlist sql statements may be written in uppercase or lowercase when this manual shows a sql statement uppercase is used for particular keywords if those keywords are under discussion to emphasize them and lowercase is used for the rest of the statement so you might see the following in a discussion of the select statement mysql select count from tblname on the other hand in a discussion of the count function the statement would be written like this mysql select count from tblname if no particular emphasis is intended all keywords are written uniformly in uppercase in syntax descriptions square brackets  and  are used to indicate optional words or clauses drop table if exists tblname when a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives the alternatives are separated by vertical bars  when one member from a set of choices may be chosen the alternatives are listed within square brackets when one member from a set of choices must be chosen the alternatives are listed within braces  and  trimboth  leading  trailing remstr from str describe  desc tblname colname  wild 13 history of mysql we once started off with the intention of using msql to connect to our tables using our own fast lowlevel isam routines however after some testing we came to the conclusion that msql was not fast enough or flexible enough for our needs this resulted in a new sql interface to our database but with almost the same api interface as msql this api was chosen to ease porting of thirdparty code the derivation of the name mysql is not perfectly clear our base directory and a large number of our libraries and tools have had the prefix my for well over 10 years however monty daughter some years younger is also named my so which of the two gave its name to mysql is still a mystery even for us 14 the main features of mysql the following list describes some of the important characteristics of mysql  fully multithreaded using kernel threads that means it easily can use multiple cpus if available  c c eiffel java perl php python and tcl apis see section 20 mysql client tools and apis  works on many different platforms see section 42 operating systems supported by mysql  many column types signedunsigned integers 1 2 3 4 and 8 bytes long float double char varchar text blob date time datetime timestamp year set and enum types see section 73 column types  very fast joins using an optimized onesweep multijoin  full operator and function support in the select and where parts of queries example mysql select concatfirstname   lastname from tblname where incomedependents  10000 and age  30  sql functions are implemented through a highlyoptimized class library and should be as fast as they can get usually there shouldnt be any memory allocation at all after query initialization  full support for sql group by and order by clauses support for group functions count countdistinct avg std sum max and min  support for left outer join with ansi sql and odbc syntax  you can mix tables from different databases in the same query as of version 322  a privilege and password system which is very flexible and secure and which allows hostbased verification passwords are secure since all password traffic when connecting to a server is encrypted  odbc opendatabaseconnectivity for windows95 with source all odbc 25 functions and many others you can for example use access to connect to your mysql server see section 16 mysql odbc support  very fast btree disk tables with index compression  16 indexes per table are allowed each index may consist of 1 to 16 columns or parts of columns the maximum index length is 256 bytes this may be changed when compiling mysql an index may use a prefix of a char or varchar field  fixedlength and variablelength records  inmemory hash tables which are used as temporary tables  handles large databases we are using mysql with some databases that contain 50000000 records  all columns have default values you can use insert to insert a subset of a table columns those columns that are not explicitly given values are set to their default values  uses gnu automake autoconf and libtool for portability  written in c and c tested with a broad range of different compilers  a very fast threadbased memory allocation system  no memory leaks tested with a commercial memory leakage detector purify  includes myisamchk a very fast utility for table checking optimization and repair see section 13 maintaining a mysql installation  full support for the iso88591 latin1 character set for example the scandinavian characters ringaccenta a and o are allowed in table and column names  all data are saved in iso88591 latin1 format all comparisons for normal string columns are case insensitive  sorting is done according to the iso88591 latin1 character set the swedish way at the moment it is possible to change this in the source by adding new sort order arrays to see an example of very advanced sorting look at the czech sorting code mysql supports many different character sets that can be specified at compile time  aliases on tables and columns as in the sql92 standard  delete insert replace and update return how many rows were changed affected  function names do not clash with table or column names for example abs is a valid column name the only restriction is that for a function call no spaces are allowed between the function name and the  that follows it see section 731 is mysql picky about reserved words  all mysql programs can be invoked with the help or  options to obtain online assistance  the server can provide error messages to clients in many languages see section 91 what languages are supported by mysql  clients connect to the mysql server using tcpip connections or unix sockets or named pipes under nt  the mysqlspecific show command can be used to retrieve information about databases tables and indexes the explain command can be used to determine how the optimizer resolves a query 15 how stable is mysql this section addresses the questions how stable is mysql and can i depend on mysql in this project here we will try to clarify some issues and to answer some of the more important questions that seem to concern many people this section has been put together from information gathered from the mailing list which is very active in reporting bugs at tcx mysql has worked without any problems in our projects since mid1996 when mysql was released to a wider public we noticed that there were some pieces of untested code that were quickly found by the new users who made queries in a manner different than our own each new release has had fewer portability problems than the previous one even though each has had many new features and we hope that it will be possible to label one of the next releases stable each release of mysql has been usable and there have been problems only when users start to use code from the gray zones naturally outside users cant know what the gray zones are this section attempts to indicate those that are currently known the descriptions deal with the 322x version of mysql all known and reported bugs are fixed in the latest version with the exception of the bugs listed in the bugs section which are things that are designrelated see section e known errors and design deficiencies in mysql mysql is written in multiple layers and different independent modules these modules are listed below with an indication of how welltested each of them is the isam table handler  stable this manages storage and retrieval of all data in mysql 322 and earlier versions in all mysql releases there hasnt been a single reported bug in this code the only known way to get a corrupted table is to kill the server in the middle of an update even that is unlikely to destroy any data beyond rescue because all data are flushed to disk between each query there hasnt been a single bug report about lost data because of bugs in mysql either the myisam table handler  beta this is new in mysql 323 it largely based on the isam table code but has a lot of new very useful features the parser and lexical analyser  stable there hasnt been a single reported bug in this system for a long time the c client code  stable no known problems in early 320 releases there were some limitations in the sendreceive buffer size as of 321x the buffer size is now dynamic up to a default of 24m standard client programs  stable these include mysql mysqladmin and mysqlshow mysqldump and mysqlimport basic sql  stable the basic sql function system and string classes and dynamic memory handling not a single reported bug in this system query optimizer  stable range optimizer  gamma join optimizer  stable locking  gamma this is very systemdependent on some systems there are big problems using standard os locking fcntl in these cases you should run the mysql daemon with the skiplocking flag problems are known to occur on some linux systems and on sunos when using nfsmounted file systems linux threads  gamma the only problem found has been with the fcntl call which is fixed by using the skiplocking option to mysqld some people have reported lockup problems with the 05 release solaris 25 pthreads  stable we use this for all our production work mitpthreads other systems  gamma there have been no reported bugs since 32015 and no known bugs since 32016 on some systems there is a misfeature where some operations are quite slow a 120 second sleep is done between each query of course mitpthreads may slow down everything a bit but indexbased select statements are usually done in one time frame so there shouldnt be a mutex lockingthread juggling other thread implementions  alpha  beta the ports to other systems are still very new and may have bugs possibly in mysql but most often in the thread implementation itself load data  insert  select  stable some people have thought they have found bugs here but these usually have turned out to be misunderstandings please check the manual before reporting problems alter table  stable small changes in 32212 dbd  stable now maintained by jochen wiedmann mysqlaccess  stable written and maintained by yves carlier grant  gamma big changes made in mysql 32212 myodbc uses odbc sdk 25  gamma it seems to work well with some programs tcx provides email support for paying customers but the mysql mailing list usually provides answers to common questions bugs are usually fixed right away with a patch for serious bugs there is almost always a new release 16 year 2000 compliance mysql itself has no problems with year 2000 y2k compliance  mysql uses unix time functions and has no problems with dates until 2069 all 2digit years are regarded to be in the range 1970 to 2069 which means that if you store 01 in a year column mysql treats it as 2001  all mysql date functions are stored in one file sqltimecc and coded very carefully to be year 2000safe  in mysql 322 and later versions the new year column type can store years 0 and 1901 to 2155 in 1 byte and display them using 2 or 4 digits you may run into problems with applications that use mysql in a way that is not y2ksafe for example many old applications store or manipulate years using 2digit values which are ambiguous rather than 4digit values this problem may be compounded by applications that use values such as 00 or 99 as missing value indicators unfortunately these problems may be difficult to fix since different applications may be written by different programmers each of whom may use a different set of conventions and datehandling functions here is a simple demonstration illustrating that mysql doesnt have any problems with dates until the year 2030 mysql drop table if exists y2k mysql create table y2k date date datetime datetime timestamp timestamp mysql insert into y2k values 1998123119981231 23595919981231235959 mysql insert into y2k

what are mysql mysql is one true multiuser the multithread sql database server sql structured query language is in the world most popular and the standardized database language mysql is by a clientserver structure realization it and the different client programs and the storehouse is composed of server daemon mysqld sql is one kind of standardized language it causes the memory the renewal and the deposit information is easier for example you can use the sql language are a website retrieval product information and save the customer information simultaneously mysql is also quick enough and nimble permits your stored record document and the image the mysql essential target is fast vigorous and healthy and easy to use at first is because we need this kind of sql server it can process with any may not the expensive hardware platform in provide the database a factory in number magnitude largescale database but the speed is quicker mysql develops since 1996 we have been using mysql its environment has surpasses 40 databases contains 10000 tables more than 500 tables surpass 7000000 lines this probably has 100 lucky byte gb key application data the mysql establishment foundation already uses production environment many year set of practical routines which requests high although mysql still in development but it already provided rich and the extremely useful function collection the mysql official pronunciation is my ess que ell is not mysequel 12 have form and so on texinfo ordinary text info html postscript and pdf about this handbook present this handbook editions because of theirs length postscript and pdf edition not including in the main mysql distribution but may obtain independent downloading from httpwwwmysqlcom the main documents are the texinfo document the html edition improve the edition production automatically with texi2html the ordinary text and the info edition produce with makeinfo the postscript edition produces by texi2dvi and dvips the pdf edition produces with pdftex this handbook by david axmark michael monty widenius paul dubois and kim aldale maintenance but other contributors see c the mysql contributor in 121 this handbook uses agreement this handbook has used certain writing form agreement the constantfixed width fixed width typeface uses in ordering the name and the choice the sql sentence the database the table and a row naming c and the perl code the environment variable for example to understand how mysqladmin does work withthe help option transfers it the filename has the surrounding quotation mark fixed width typeface to use in the filename and the way for example the release edition is installed in usrlocal under the table of contents c has the surrounding quotation mark fixed width typeface also to use in indicating the character sequence for example must assign a wildcard character the use    the character the italics italics typeface uses in stressing like this the bold bold uses in depositing and withdrawing the jurisdiction name eg do not be authorized the process jurisdiction easily and expresses emphasized specially when orders to demonstrate when preparation by a specific program execution procedure the prompt symbol which demonstrated by the order pointed out for example shellgt indicated that you register the outer covering from you to carry out an order but mysqlgt indicates you from the mysql customer executive command shellgt enters shell in this to order mysqlgt to enter mysql in here to order the shell order grammar to demonstrate with bourne the shell if you are using the csh style the outer covering you possibly need to use the different way to issue the order slightly for example establishes an environment variable and moves an order sequence grammar to look like in bourne the shell like this shellgt varnamevalue somecommand regarding csh you will carry out such sequence shellgt setenv varname value shellgt somecommand database the table and a row name must substitute frequently in the order in order to indicate that this kind of substitution is necessary this handbook uses dbname tblname and colname for example you possibly see such sentence mysqlgt

authorname from bibliodbauthorlist the sql sentence might write the capital letter or the small letter when this handbook demonstrates the sql sentence if discusses these key words the capital letter uses in the specific key words emphasizing they but the small letter uses in the sentence other parts therefore you possibly in discuss time the select sentence saw demonstrated as follows mysqlgt select count from tblname on the other hand when discusses the count function the sentence will write this mysqlgt select count from tblname if does not intend to stress specially all key words all

using msql with ours fast first floor isam utility program however later we will obtain in some tests gives a written guarantee theory msql is not very fast to our demand and nimble this caused one to connect our database the new sql connection but it had nearly with the msql same application programming interface chooses this application programming interface by to facilitate the third party the code transplant the mysql name origin is not very clear our base table of contents and many storehouses and the tool have the prefix my to surpass 10 year history however the monty daughter young several yearold is also named  my  therefore which reason gave this name for mysql was still a riddle even to us 14 mysql chief feature next tables describe mysql some important characteristics  use

stable degreecan rely on mysql with me in this project here we will attempt to clarify some questions and replied as if many people cared more important question this with from the mail tabulation it at report mistake was already very active has collected the information integration in together to tcx mysql in we from 1996 intermediate stages start in the plan moves has not given rise to any problem when mysql is issued publicly we noted had some not to test the code the piece to be very quickly different with ours inquiry way new user discovery each new edition has a less probability question compared to preceding  although each release has many new functions and we hoped that has the possibility of a mark next editions is stable each mysql release is available and only then when the user use comes from the pessimistic region when code only then has the question certainly does not know the circumstances of the matter the user cannot know that the pessimistic region is anything this section attempt promulgates us at present the known thing here description involves mysql 3 22x editions all known and the report mistake can correct in the newest edition except lists in the wrong section with designs n the related mistake for details sees e the mysql known mistake and the design defects mysql by the sandwich construction and the different independent module compilation

in all mysql edition in the code already did not have one independent report wrong obtains a damage database table only known method is kills the server in a renewal midway even if like this not greatly possible to destroy any data but cannot save because all data pour into between each inquiry flush to arrive the floppy disk moreover never has one to concern as a result of the mysql in

possibly had the mistake possibly was in mysql what but was most usual was the thread realizes itself load data insert select stabilized some people already to think that they have discovered the mistake in here but these many were the misunderstandings frequently please before reporting that the question inspects the handbook alter table stabilizes has the small change in 32212 dbd stable maintained now by jochen wiedmann mysqlaccess stabilizes compiles by yves carlier and maintains grant  gamma mysql 32212 has made the very big change myodbc uses odbc sdk 25 gamma it as if works with some procedures very well tcx is the payment customer provides the email the support but the mysql mail tabulation usually provides the frequently asked questions the answer wrong usually immediately uses a patch patching to the serious mistake nearly always has the new edition release 16 complied with in 2000 year 2000 compliance mysql itself oneself in 2000 not to have the question y2k  mysql uses the unix function of time and does not have the date question before 2069 all 2 years were considered that in 1970 to 2069 scope this mean if save in a year type row 01 mysql treats as it 2001  all mysql date function saves in a document  sqltimecczhong and coded the guarantee is very carefully in 2000 is safe  mysql 322 and later edition the new year type row could save 0 years in a byte and 1901 to 2155 and with used 2 or 4 demonstrates them you may use one kind are not the y2ksafe way use the mysql application procedure to penetrate this question for example many old application procedures use 2 digit it to have ambiguity but the non4 digital storage or operation year this question is possible and the use such as 00 or 99 achievement the loss the value prompt application procedure confuses very unfortunate these questions are very possibly difficult to repair because the different application procedure possibly compiles by the different programmer each possibility has used the different agreement and the date processing function here is the simple demonstration demonstrated mysql before 2030 does not have any date question mysqlgt drop table if exists y2k mysqlgt

somalias pirates flourish in a lawless nation boosaaso somalia  this may be one of the most dangerous towns in somalia a place where you can get kidnapped faster than you can wipe the sweat off your brow but it is also one of the most prosperous money changers walk around with thick wads of hundreddollar bills palatial new houses are rising up next to tinroofed shanties men in jail reminisce with a twinkle in their eyes about their days living like kings this is the story of somalias booming notsounderground pirate economy the country is in chaos countless children are starving and people are killing one another in the streets of mogadishu the capital for a handful of grain but one particular line of work  piracy  seems to be benefiting quite openly from all this lawlessness and desperation this year somali officials say pirate profits are on track to reach a record 50 million all of it tax free these guys are making a killing said mohamud muse hirsi the top somali official in boosaaso who himself is widely suspected of working with the pirates though he vigorously denies it more than 75 vessels have been attacked this year far more than any other year in recent memory about a dozen have been set upon in the past month alone including a ukrainian freighter packed with tanks antiaircraft guns and other heavy weaponry which was brazenly seized in september the pirates use fastmoving skiffs to pull alongside their prey and scamper on board with ladders or sometimes even rusty grappling hooks once on deck they hold the crew at gunpoint until a ransom is paid usually 1 million to 2 million negotiations for the ukrainian freighter are still going on and it is likely that because of all the publicity the price for the ship could top 5 million in somalia it seems crime does pay actually it is one of the few industries that does all you need is three guys and a little boat and the next day youre millionaires said abdullahi omar qawden a former captain in somalias longdefunct navy people in garoowe a town south of boosaaso describe a certain highrolling pirate swagger flush with cash the pirates drive the biggest cars run many of the towns businesses  like hotels  and throw the best parties residents say fatuma abdul kadir said she went to a pirate wedding in july that lasted two days with nonstop dancing and goat meat and a band flown in from neighboring djibouti it was wonderful said ms fatuma 21 im now dating a pirate this is too much for many somali men to resist and criminals from all across this bulletpocked land are now flocking to boosaaso and other notorious pirate dens along the craggy somali shore they have turned these waters into the most dangerous shipping lanes in the world with the situation clearly out of control warships from the united states russia nato the european union and india are steaming into somalias waters as part of a reinvigorated worldwide effort to crush the pirates but it will not be easy the pirates are sea savvy they are fearless they are rich and getting richer with the latest hightech gadgetry like handheld gps units and they are united the immutable clan lines that have pitted somalis against one another for decades are not a problem here several captured pirates interviewed in boosaasos main jail said that they had recently crossed clan lines to open new lucrative multiclan franchises we work together said jama abdullahi a jailed pirate good for business you know the pirates are also sprinkled across thousands of square miles of water from the gulf of aden at the narrow doorway to the red sea to the kenyan border along the indian ocean even if the naval ships manage to catch pirates in the act it is not clear what they can do in september a danish warship captured 10 men suspected of being pirates cruising around the gulf of aden with rocketpropelled grenades and a long ladder but after holding the suspects for nearly a week the danes concluded that they did not have jurisdiction to prosecute so they dumped the pirates on a beach minus their guns nobody it seems has a clear plan for how to tame somalias unruly seas several fishermen along the gulf of aden talked about seeing barrels of toxic waste bobbing in the middle of the ocean they spoke of clouds of dead fish floating nearby and rogue fishing trawlers sucking up not just fish and lobsters but also the coral and the plants that sustain them it was abuses like these several men said that turned them from fishermen into pirates nor is it even clear whether somali authorities universally want the piracy to stop while many pirates have been arrested several fishermen western researchers and more than a halfdozen pirates in jail spoke of nefarious relationships among fishing companies private security contractors and somali government officials especially those working for the semiautonomous regional government of puntland believe me a lot of our money has gone straight into the governments pockets said farah ismail eid a pirate who was captured in nearby berbera and sentenced to 15 years in jail his pirate team he said typically divided up the loot this way 20 percent for their bosses 20 percent for future missions to cover essentials like guns fuel and cigarettes 30 percent for the gunmen on the ship and 30 percent for government officials abdi waheed johar the director general of the fisheries and ports ministry of puntland openly acknowledged in an interview this spring that there are government people working with the pirates but he was quick to add its just not us what is happening off somalias shores is basically an extension of the corrupt violent freeforall that has raged on land for 17 years since the central government imploded in 1991 the vast majority of somalis lose out young thugs who are willing to serve as muscle get a job albeit a lowpaying one that significantly reduces their life expectancy and a select few warlords who have sat down and figured out how to profit off the anarchy make a fortune take boosaaso once a thriving port town on the gulf of aden piracy is killing off the remains of the local fishing industry because export companies are staying away it has spawned a kidnapping business on shore which in turn has scared away many humanitarian agencies and the food medicine and other forms of desperately needed assistance they bring reporting in boosaaso two weeks ago required no fewer than 10 hired gunmen provided by the puntland government to discourage any wouldbe kidnappers few large cargo ships come here anymore depriving legitimate government operations of muchneeded port taxes just about the only ships willing to risk the voyage are small wooden puttputt freighters from india essentially floating jalopies from another era we cant survive off this said bile qabowsade a puntland official the shipping problems have contributed to food shortages skyrocketing inflation and less work for the sinewy stevedores who trudge out to boosaasos beach every morning and stare in vain at the bright horizon their bare feet planted in the hot sand hoping a ship will materialize so they will be able to make a few pennies hauling 100pound sacks of sugar on their backs and yet suspiciously there has been a lot of new construction in boosaaso there is an emerging section of town called new boosaaso with huge homes rising above the bubbleshaped huts of refugees and the ironsided shacks that many fishermen call home these new houses cost several hundred thousand dollars many are painted in garish colors and protected by high walls even so boosaaso is still a crumbling broke roughandtumble place decaying after years of neglect like so much of warravaged somalia it is also dangerous in countless ways on wednesday suicide bombers blew up two government offices most likely the work of islamist radicals trying to turn somalia into an islamist state of course no somali government official would openly admit that new boosaasos minicastles were built with pirate proceeds but many people including united nations officials and western diplomats suspect that is the case several jailed pirates have accused mr muse a former warlord who is now puntlands president of being paid off officials in neighboring somaliland a breakaway region of northwestern somalia said they recently organized an antipiracy sting operation and arrested mr muses nephew who was carrying 22000 in cash top puntland officials benefit from piracy even if they might not be instigating it said roger middleton a researcher at the royal institute of international affairs in london actually he added all significant political actors in somalia are likely benefiting from piracy but mr muse said he did not know anything about this we are the leaders of this country he said everybody we suspect we fire from work he said that puntland was taking aggressive action against the pirates and boosaasos main jail may be proof of that the other day a dozen pirates were hanging out in the yard under a basketball hoop and that was just the beginning pirates pirates pirates said gure ahmed a canadiansomali inmate of the jail charged with murder this jail is full of pirates this whole city is pirates in other wellknown pirate dens like garoowe eyl hobyo and xarardheere pirates have become local celebrities said farah 32 a shopkeeper in garoowe said the pirates seemed to have money to burn if they see a good car that a guy is driving he said they say how much if its 30 grand take 40 and give me the key  every time a seized ship tosses its anchor it means a pirate shopping spree sheep goats water fuel rice spaghetti milk and cigarettes  the pirates buy all of this in large quantities from small towns up and down the somali coast somalias seafaring thieves are not like the barbary pirates who terrorized european coastal towns hundreds of years ago and often turned their hostages into galley slaves chained to the oars somali pirates are known as relatively decent hosts usually not beating their hostages and keeping them wellfed until payday comes they are normal people said mr said just very very rich
