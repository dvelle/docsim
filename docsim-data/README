=====                   Introduction                    ====
============================================================
This package retrieves web pages from remote search engines.

User should provide a file containing URLs of web pages to be retrieved. A
sample file is located at src/main/resources/searchResult.txt.

Here is sample content:
    Query: French warship captures pirates
    TotalResult: 2
    Title: French warship captures pirates
    Url: http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/africa/8000447.stm
    Title: French warship captures pirates
    Url: http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=56801

    Query: anti tax tea party
    TotalResult: 2
    Title: Anti-Tax 'Tea Party' Protesters Rally On Capitol Steps In Olympia
    Url: http://opbnews.org/article/4776-anti-tax-tea-party-protesters-rally-capitol-steps-olympia/
    Title: Anti-tax tea party rallies draw crowds despite rain, setbacks
    Url: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/43051552.html

Query: this is the query keywords that are sent to search engine.
TotalResult: this is number of returned results from search engine.
Title: title of a search result returned from search engine.
Url: url of a web page returned from search engine.

Each web page is stored in a separate file. It is named <number>.html.

This program accepts following options:
 -c,--config <arg>             Specify the configuration file
 -d,--output-directory <arg>   output directory
 -h,--help                     display help document
 -o,--output-file <arg>        output xml file

For example, for command
  mvn -Pretrieve -Dexec.args="-c src/main/resources/searchResult.txt -d pages -o output"
  The input file is src/main/resources/searchResult.txt; results would be
written to directory pages and the output file prefix is output. 

Three summary files are generated to describe the relationship among these web pages.
  <base-name>.shingle: used by Zhenhua's shingleing algorithm
  <base-name>.lsa:  used by JiaYi's LSA program.
  <base-name>.txt:  human-readable output for debuggin purpose.

Sample output is stored in directory "pages" in current directory.

=====                   Running in maven                ====
============================================================
    mvn test
    mvn -Pretrieve 
      ( Equivalent to
       mvn -Pretrieve -Dexec.args="-c src/main/resources/searchResult.txt -d . -o output.txt"
       )

view help doc:
    mvn -Pretrieve -Dexec.args="-h"

Sample:
    mvn -Pretrieve -Dexec.args="-d pages -o output22.txt"
    mvn -Pretrieve -Dexec.args="-c src/main/resources/searchResult.txt -d pages -o output22.txt"

============================================================
=====   Separate Independent Package Running            ====
============================================================
First a independent jar should be built.
    mvn package
    mvn assembly:assembly

view help doc
    java -jar docsim-data-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h

Usually the command sequence should be:
    mkdir pages
    java -jar docsim-data-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar -c searchResult.txt -d pages

Then all pages would be downloaded and stored in directory 'pages'.
